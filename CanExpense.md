# CanExpense requirements

Inherits [canlang requirements](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md) and [workspace operator context](WORKSPACE_OPERATOR.md), with [portfolio composition](PORTFOLIO.md). Companion draft: [CanExpense.can](CanExpense.can).

## Purpose and Adoption Goal

Help workspace employees claim approved travel between locations, emergency supplies, and other out-of-pocket operating expenses. Adoption depends on private receipt submission and finance knowing what remains to reimburse.

## Users and Permissions

Employees submit and read their own expenses; eligible assigned reviewers see and decide those submissions. Finance members record reimbursement. A claimant cannot approve their own expense, and ordinary team membership alone does not grant access to every receipt.

## Data and Ownership

Each expense has a business description and belongs to its claimant's team. Expense stores claimant, amount/currency, business date, receipt, assigned eligible reviewer, submission revision, and decision actor/time. Reimbursement records its external payment reference and date; it is distinct from an approval.

The location is the first-version cost center. Record expense category, business purpose and an optional external job or purchase authorization reference. That reference is evidence text, not an imported operation or an automatic permission grant. Keep reimbursement currency distinct from claim currency; first-version reimbursement evidence must match the claim currency.

## Workflows and Business Rules

Freeze amount and receipt when submitted. The reviewer approves or rejects that revision; a rejected claim can be corrected and resubmitted with its earlier decision retained. The correction stores an immutable link to the rejected claim; that claim can create one successor draft, which is edited through canonical CRUD. Current claimant location access is required. Submission requires the actual package reviewer grant, distinct claimant/reviewer accounts and current location eligibility for both. If a submitted reviewer loses that grant or eligibility, the eligible claimant can withdraw with a reason and create one correction draft with a new eligible reviewer. The withdrawn original keeps its locked amount, receipt and assignment; withdrawal is not a rejection or reviewer decision. An approved/reimbursed claim cannot use this recovery, and a stale or repeated withdrawal is rejected. Finance can mark an approved claim reimbursed once using payment evidence. Payment references are trimmed and checked across all team reimbursements under the owner transaction fence, not just under one claim. Use the unique bank transaction or statement-line reference, not a reused batch label. The amount/currency must match and the payment date cannot be later than today at the expense location. These are records of reimbursement, not an automatic bank transfer.

Before submission, the claimant transcribes the receipt's claimed amount, date and merchant from the frozen receipt file while the claim is a draft; these are staff attestations, not automated extraction. Submission requires at least one transcription exactly matching the claim amount and business date. Transcriptions are immutable: corrections are new rows, never edits, and reviewers compare them against the frozen receipt. Existing installations have no automatic backfill: previously submitted expenses without a transcription keep their current state; only new submit calls enforce the guard.

## Pages and Interactions

Use the [shared shell and personal configuration](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md#standard-shell-and-personal-configuration). Declared sidebar pages are My expenses (`/expenses/mine`) for employees and Expense review (`/expenses/review`) for assigned reviewers/finance. Claims, receipts and the finance reimbursement queue stay contextual. Use daisyUI for ordinary employee/review/finance work.

| Page or logical destination | Components and content layout | Canonical actions and conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| My expenses | Own-claim Table/List ordered by business date, status/location/category/date filters and create Fieldset for purpose, cost center, amount/currency, receipt and reviewer. An in-context saved status default, receipt-first edit, receipt download link, gated correction comparison, decisions/reimbursements accordion timelines and copyable payment reference complete the journey. | Existing claimant create/edit and submit operations require private ownership and an eligible distinct reviewer with the actual reviewer grant. Withdraw an unavailable submitted review with a reason; use the single-successor correction operation to choose another reviewer. Draft fields remain editable only under their existing guards. |
| Claim revision and receipt | Summary Card with frozen submission amount, receipt download and revision; Decision history Collapse showing reviewer, actor/time and rejection reason. | Receipt access follows document/claim policies. Correct/resubmit rejected or withdrawn claims through owning operations; old decisions remain tied to their submitted receipt and amount. |
| Assigned review | Claimant/status/location/category/date Select filters above a Table of eligible assigned submissions with claimant, location, category, date, amount/currency and state; reason Fieldset with decision Buttons. The table becomes a status-grouped `board` (`by=status`) with purpose search, pager and per-claim decide/reimburse dialogs; decisions/reimbursements stay tabbed. | Only the assigned reviewer decides the frozen revision; self-approval and stale revision edits fail server checks. |
| Reimbursement and accounting | Claimant/status/location/category/date filters, pending-approved Table, evidence Fieldset for external reference/date/amount and separate reimbursement Badge/history; authorized CSV export with receipt references via the shared toolbar. The approved queue uses the same reimburse dialog (no authored export button). | Finance records evidenced reimbursement once, in the matching claim currency. Approval is not a bank transfer; unique payment references and finance authority remain enforced. |

Show empty own claims, no assigned submissions and no pending reimbursement separately. A failed receipt upload preserves draft inputs without showing a valid submitted receipt; retries never replace evidence for a past decision. Pending mutations disable repeats and retain revision/reference. A stale decision or duplicate-reference conflict produces an Alert with the authoritative result rather than a successful status edit. Preserve unsaved reasons/evidence; confirm discard. On narrow screens stack labeled claim Cards and Fieldsets, keeping claimant, currency, revision and receipt access readable. CSV availability and receipt links remain scoped; membership grants no colleague-receipt access.

## Personal Configuration

Inherit shared base settings in the own-user dialog. Remember a user's own/review queue filter and compact/comfortable expense-list presentation within scope. Queue-filter memory is editable in context via the saved-default filter; the shared dialog keeps the same setting. Preferences never change reviewers, receipt privacy, submission locks, currency or finance authority. No setup/admin tab is required.

## Interfaces and Integrations

Use D1 for expense records and R2 for receipts.

## Background Actions

None in the first version.

## Error Handling

Reject unauthorized receipt access, self-approval, and edits to a decided revision. Prevent duplicate reimbursement references. Show failed uploads without creating an apparently valid receipt or altering a past decision.

## Scope and Completion

Complete when private submissions reach an eligible reviewer, changed receipts require a new decision, and a reimbursement can be recorded once with evidence.

A technician can submit a travel receipt against a location, receive a reasoned decision, and see the separately evidenced reimbursement without other employees seeing the receipt.

Frontend completion additionally requires these journeys:

- A technician submits a private location travel receipt, sees a reasoned rejection, corrects it and reads both revision decisions; colleagues cannot download the receipt.
- Finance opens an approved claim, records matching-currency payment evidence once and exports authorized accounting references, while the claimant sees approval and reimbursement as distinct outcomes.

## Composition and Ownership

Recommended placement: Finance. Own private claimant submissions, expense decisions and reimbursement evidence. A shared finance UI or CanApprove review component cannot bypass receipt privacy, self-review restrictions or finance reimbursement authority. See [portfolio composition and ownership](PORTFOLIO.md). Focused example requirements remain valid; composing packages does not require a new source file or an independent deployment per package.

## Draft completion evidence

Source and desired JavaScript preserve the actual noncaller reviewer-role check, current claimant/reviewer workplace eligibility, frozen claim evidence and the reason-bearing withdrawal of an unavailable submitted review. Rejected and withdrawn originals retain their receipt, amount and reviewer, and can create one successor draft through the correction operation. Canonical draft CRUD permits choosing another reviewer and changing the successor receipt; submission rechecks current authority. Finance still records a matching-currency reimbursement separately, using normalized team-wide payment references and the actual finance caller in its server-owned evidence.

The original nine inline tables contain 49 authored rows: valid distinct reviewer/finance accounts, active ordinary-worker denial, self-review, workplace eligibility loss, unavailable-review withdrawal, stale versions, repeated withdrawal, rejected/withdrawn correction, retained rejection evidence, duplicate references, mismatched amounts/currencies and future payment dates. No successor is seeded solely to imitate the result of correction: connected examples create it through the actual operation. Named account recipes preserve noncaller roles; an Employee's work-role label confers no reviewer grant. Isolated rows exercise provisioned current states. The original three additional shared-state sequences specify 26 canonical calls across 57 call/binding/assertion steps: claimant submission → reviewer approval → finance reimbursement; reasoned rejection → single correction → a distinct receipt → resubmission and reimbursement; and actual `employee.deactivate` eligibility loss → denied review → withdrawal → one successor with a new eligible reviewer → approval and reimbursement. The recovery sequence checks both a captured stale version and a fresh repeated withdrawal, and repeats correction to verify the single-successor boundary. Newly created records are re-queried after mutation before the next version-sensitive call. Earlier committed steps and their receipt/decision evidence must survive each expected rejection.

The initial parser accepts the production declarations and tables after removing the proposed sequence blocks from a temporary inspection copy. It rejects the full source at the first sequence block, as expected from the documented parser boundary; the new sequence grammar has been manually checked against DESIGN §5.1/§13. JavaScript syntax and focused source/target correspondence checks pass. These checks do not execute expectations, provision accounts or prove receipt/download privacy. There is still no specified canonical teams-operation signature for live declared-role revocation; fixed ordinary-user recipes demonstrate role absence, while only employee eligibility revocation is represented as an actual transition. Role-change journeys, the compiler/runner and runtime privacy checks remain unimplemented. The production policies retain claimant privacy and current assigned-reviewer/finance eligibility; rendering, file authorization and transaction fences remain proposed runtime contracts.


## Authorized reviewer selection

Claim intake first binds the caller's active Employee and an eligible work location, then invokes the single canonical `reviewer_choices(location)` read. Browser result rows show permitted work name, user identity, work role and home location; the selected `candidate.user` is explicitly bound to the existing Expense.create reviewer input, together with claimant and location. MCP uses that same read and canonical create/update operations. No second reviewer signature, account/email directory or custom picker service exists. Lookup covers distinct current reviewer-role holders eligible at that location; create/submission guards still independently recheck current authority. Existing draft edit and correction workflows remain available, and MCP may reuse the lookup for reviewer changes.

Employee work names are optional owner-maintained data, readable under the existing staff work-field grant and maintained through the canonical HR CRUD. Names are not identity keys: the candidate user remains visible so equally named reviewers are distinguishable, and null names retain the shared safe ID fallback. This does not reveal private_notes, manager, employment dates or HR documents to staff selecting another reviewer. External/unauthenticated callers gain no directory from the new read.

Eight added table rows cover equal names without identity merging, self exclusion despite holding the reviewer role, actual role absence on an equally named ordinary worker, inactive reviewer/claimant, missing work location, null name and outside/public caller denial. A new three-call shared-state sequence reads the reviewer, invokes the existing HR Employee.deactivate operation, then reads an empty result while the role assignment remains. These are authored expectations, not executed runtime proof. Private-field exclusion is checked against the actual Employee read policy and ordinary read-result projection contract; inspection-context assertions are not claimed as proof of response redaction. Four sequences in total remain beyond the initial full-file parser/runner implementation.


### Historical evidence intake

Historical source claims are retained through `retain_legacy` under current finance/work-location authority, separately from live Expense, Decision and Reimbursement records. The locked source namespace/key, original actor/reviewer text, original/parsed dates, claimed status, exact optional money and finalized receipt preserve the source assertions without replaying old approvals or payments. Missing historical accounts remain text; missing receipts require an explicit explanation rather than fabricated evidence. The required finalized source export remains finance-only because it may contain other people's data. Claimants receive only their own normalized historical claim and its individual receipt after an explicitly verified account match.

`link_legacy` grants, corrects or revokes current claimant access with a reason and fresh record version. It cannot rewrite locked source facts. The account must match a real Employee identity associated with the location; a missing/ambiguous match remains unlinked and finance-only. The operator must verify the original personnel key rather than infer identity from equal names or emails. `/expenses/history` supplies canonical CSV retention with `legacy_matches` review, exact source-key lookup, authorized historical rows and a finance-only access-mapping action. The same authenticated ordinary read returns only current readable rows to browser and MCP callers; it adds no authority-report bypass. Source/record keys are not generic raw-write inputs.

CSV input uses the existing 1,000-row/10 MiB review bound and ordinary finalized-file controls, with per-row receipts and explicit duplicate review. Same-operation retries preserve their identity and frozen input; a fresh operation using an existing source key fails instead of silently overwriting or upserting. P's 2,000 records/receipts therefore require at least two reviews and explicit disposition of every attachment. Partial or unknown rows, unsupported original formats and unresolved accounts remain visible reconciliation work; an immutable conflicting transcription requires an owning correction decision rather than a forged new source key. This does not establish complete migration of a real dataset.

Fourteen isolated intake/lookup/mapping rows and one additional connected journey specify the new behavior. Its 14 canonical calls retain evidence with finance-owned uploaded-file fixtures, link a claimant, obtain an ordinary viewer result, reject a stale mapping edit, revoke access, observe an empty viewer result, link a corrected account, reject a duplicate source key, deactivate the finance Employee through HR and reject further finance mapping. A caller without finance is separately denied. The frozen original claim remains unchanged and no live Expense, Decision or Reimbursement appears. Viewer-read result counts test requested row visibility through production reads; source-export/file serialization privacy still needs runtime testing. HR deactivation is an actual workplace-eligibility change, not a claimed team-role removal.

Both the existing and historical journeys remain authored specifications. JavaScript syntax and a temporary source projection excluding unsupported sequence bodies/CSV form attributes pass; the prototype does not implement those contracts, semantic checking, file transfer, imports, replay or permission-filtered results. The retained [intake design](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/design/historical-intake-20261004.md) preserves JEV uncertainty, source-data unknowns, attachment/retry mapping and the separate W booking/invoice obligations.

The sequence reuses one typed historical claim value rather than copying its source assertions at each invocation. Each nullable row lookup has an explicit nonnull assertion before later use. Same-operation receipt replay remains a shared runtime acceptance requirement; the current bounded sequence notation intentionally does not author replay identities. No fabricated operation ID or implied replay test is used.
