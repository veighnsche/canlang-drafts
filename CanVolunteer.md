# CanVolunteer requirements

Inherits [canlang requirements](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md) and [workspace operator context](WORKSPACE_OPERATOR.md), with [portfolio composition](PORTFOLIO.md). Companion draft: [CanVolunteer.can](CanVolunteer.can).

## Purpose and Adoption Goal

Optionally help workspace community teams organize member volunteers for mentoring sessions, community events, and charity activities. Adoption depends on clear signup capacity and participants knowing their own assignments.

## Users and Permissions

Organizers manage opportunities and assignments. Public visitors discover open opportunities within the selected team. Authenticated volunteers manage their own signup and complete their own assigned tasks; the assignments tab requires authentication without requiring operator-team membership. Organizers see their organization's attendance; volunteer contact details and tasks are not a public roster.

## Data and Ownership

Opportunities have a title; assignments store task text and belong to a volunteer's signup. Opportunity stores timezone, interval, capacity, and open/cancelled state. Signup is unique per volunteer/opportunity and retains registration/confirmation/withdrawal history. Task completion records its volunteer/coordinator actor and time.

Record sponsoring location, organizer contact, activity description, volunteer requirements, attendance outcome, and any confirmed venue reservation reference. Volunteers are customer/community accounts, not automatically operator employees.

## Workflows and Business Rules

Registering deliberately reserves a place; withdrawal releases it once. Prevent duplicate or overlapping active signups within the organization. Organizers confirm volunteers and can cancel an opportunity, immediately releasing its places and invalidating its tasks/reminders while retaining history; stored signup states and cancellation notices then complete eventually.

Organizers record attended/no_show after the activity while preserving prior confirmation. A reschedule re-checks volunteer conflicts and capacity and requires affected volunteers to reconfirm if their availability changed. If a rentable venue is required, confirm it through CanRent before publishing; volunteer capacity does not reserve a room.

## Pages and Interactions

Use the staged [shared shell and personal configuration](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md#standard-shell-and-personal-configuration). Sidebar order is Volunteer activities /volunteering, then Volunteer coordination /volunteering/work for organizers. Own signup/task history stays local; volunteers are community customers rather than employee roster members, and no additional administration console is needed.

| Page or logical destination | DaisyUI presentation and content | Owning actions and conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity discovery /volunteering | Location filter and Opportunity List with capacity Badge, instructions, requirements, timezone/interval and remaining-places Stat; signup is a bound Button. | signup reserves one place after capacity/conflict checks; only published eligible opportunities appear and venue capacity remains CanRent-owned. |
| Own signups and tasks | Own Signup List with state, cancellation and reconfirmation Statuses and per-signup history; Task List with completion Button shows instructions and completion actor/time. | withdraw releases once; complete requires the current own confirmed assignment, without exposing other volunteers' contacts/tasks. |
| Volunteer coordination /volunteering/work | Opportunity Fieldset (location/title/description/requirements/venue controls) and List with Pagination, remaining Badge, open/cancelled/venue Statuses, publication and cancellation actions, and scoped participant List. | Opportunity CRUD, publish/cancel follow organizer location grants; venue fulfillment precedes publication when required. |
| Assignments, attendance and history | Signup List with Pagination, state, cancellation and reconfirmation Statuses, attendance Modal with attend Toggle, generated task intake, and notice delivery state; per-signup history. | confirm, attendance and Task CRUD use organizer scope; recorded attended/no_show is distinct from confirmation. Rescheduling rechecks conflicts/capacity and affected volunteer agreement. |

Mobile Cards retain interval/timezone, remaining capacity, own state and instructions. Loading, full, empty and unavailable venue/eligibility states are separate. Keep signup or task input on validation/conflict and show the authoritative outcome, not optimistically claimed capacity. Pending/failed notification remains separate from committed registration/withdrawal. Cancellation invalidates tasks/reminders, retaining history; stale screens cannot revive a cancelled activity. Organizer participant information stays private, including exports; volunteering never satisfies employee role/skill coverage.

## Personal Configuration

Inherit [shared shell and personal configuration](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md#standard-shell-and-personal-configuration) for persistent validated language/appearance and account/security controls. Preferences remember authorized location/date/type filters and discovery versus own-assignment view, reset through the shared own-user action. They do not register attendance, reserve a place/venue, change business timezone or confer organizer/staff authority. Activity requirements and notification scheduling remain canonical business behavior; integration setup stays outside personal configuration.

## Interfaces and Integrations

Use the shared team D1 authority for records, signup capacity and organization-wide volunteer conflicts, with the standard bound email capability for reminders. The authored draft declares no Durable Object binding; moving each opportunity to an independent object would split the current conflict transaction and requires a separately designed workflow.

Declare venue booking or event linkage when configured. Volunteering does not satisfy paid employee roster coverage or bypass staff role/skill requirements.

## Background Actions

Remind confirmed volunteers one day before start using current opportunity state: every committed Opportunity write triggers a refresh pass that cancels each keyed pending reminder and re-arms it only for a currently confirmed, venue-satisfied, future signup of that opportunity, using current parent and signup versions. Cancelling an opportunity notifies affected volunteers of the captured reason; each stored cancellation and its guarded notice completes eventually after the immediate parent cancellation. Material reschedules and venue invalidations still notify synchronously in their own transactions; do not send stale reminders.

## Error Handling

Explain full opportunities and invalid ranges or volunteer references. Withdrawal must remove the reservation and pending reminder; expose notification failures.

## Scope and Completion

Complete when volunteers can actually sign up and use their tasks, duplicate signup cannot take two places, and withdrawal/cancellation releases capacity without leaking the roster.

Use this app only if such activities exist. Members can sign up to mentor at a community session, receive tasks, and have attendance recorded without becoming staff or overbooking its venue.

Frontend acceptance journeys:

- Two volunteers request the last place: one reservation wins and duplicate signup consumes no second place. The participant reads private task instructions, receives an explicit completion result and can withdraw with capacity/reminder release once.
- An organizer cancels or materially reschedules an activity: affected volunteers see cancellation or reconfirmation needs, stale reminders do not send, and venue conflicts remain visible. Attendance is recorded separately without exposing a public roster or implying staff coverage.

## Composition and Ownership

Recommended placement: Optional community volunteering. Own volunteer signup capacity, attendance and tasks. CanRent owns rentable venues; source assignments may appear in CanDo without becoming employee roster shifts. See [portfolio composition and ownership](PORTFOLIO.md). Focused example requirements remain valid; composing packages does not require a new source file or an independent deployment per package.

## Current authored draft contract

The draft reuses a withdrawn signup on reactivation, retaining its unique identity/history and reserving only one place; the authenticated caller's canonical actor.email remains the destination convention. A material interval, timezone or venue change rechecks capacity/conflicts and an entitled venue, cancels old reminders, retains places and requires volunteer consent before organizer reconfirmation. Direct venue linkage is limited to an unchanged venue or an unpublished activity without active signups; linking after signup uses the reason-bearing material-change path. Completed tasks and attendance history remain distinct. Cancelling sets parent truth immediately and emits OpportunityCancelled with the captured reason; each signup child then stores cancelled and one guarded notice intent. Effective reservation (`reserves_place`) and effective cancellation (`cancelled`) derive from stored state plus parent truth, so remaining capacity, the capacity invariant, public availability, overlap-conflict queries and Task CRUD release immediately at parent cancellation instead of waiting for stored updates; withdraw additionally refuses an effectively cancelled signup, and both participant lists show the Cancelled caption once effective. Parent cancellation success means the activity is cancelled and its durable trigger committed, not that every child already ran; operator progress must expose remaining/failed children, and a failed child never makes the parent usable again.

Venue is an optional actual CanRent Booking reference, never a caller-set confirmation boolean. Publishing/linking/rescheduling checks current confirmed/occupied entitlement, paid/free/on_account payment, consumed/not-required allowance and complete interval/location coverage. Selecting an initial or replacement venue checks CanRent's exported `can_read_booking_details` predicate; link/reschedule additionally require current entitlement: the source owner defines full-field visibility once, so an opaque-ID input cannot bypass it. An Opportunity.create hook enforces the initial linkage boundary; unrelated later title/description edits do not require a renewed booking-detail grant. Volunteer signup/task paths and trusted invalidation retain their separate authorized eligibility checks. The exported verified ReservationChanged occurrence closes an invalid venue-dependent activity and invalidates confirmations/reminders with revision-guarded notices. This is explicit event consumption. The current composed declarations all use default team D1, so package boundaries do not split their storage transaction; the notification/event runtime and current-reference rechecks remain unimplemented. Public availability is a bounded authority aggregate without participant grants; work/work_detail returns only current own eligible tasks. Nonmaterial activity edits and explicit publish/link writes commit without reminder loops; the committed refresh pass replaces each keyed pending reminder from current parent and signup versions and current eligibility, and can never re-arm a cancelled parent or overwrite a signup state. Creation/confirmation's record-addressed reminder scheduling stays, and every Reminder admission and dispatch parent-cancellation check is retained. Material reschedule and venue invalidation keep their synchronous bounded loops and exact previously confirmed recipients; count/aggregate resource limits still fail honestly, and replacing those loops alone remains rejected.

The latest reminder/change/cancellation attempt is associated with its signup as `delivery(Mail.send)` and its authorized status is shown in own and organizer views; signup policies grant only delivery identity/status leaves, never transport request/result/error content. Receipt status remains separate from signup state and attendance; association advances the signup once, so reminder dispatch uses its resulting version while scheduled admission checks the original event revision. Attendance is recorded after the activity interval ends. Own-assignment listing explicitly selects the authenticated caller even when that caller also has organizer grants. No per-child example cases are authored for cancel_signup or refresh_reminders: individual child business cases await specified handler-fixture binding, and cohort sizes, crashes, fresh reads, interleavings and dispatcher fairness need shared-runtime fixtures, so no invented each selectors are authored. These are authored source/desired-target contracts, not executed workflow proof.
