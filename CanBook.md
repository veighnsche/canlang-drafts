# CanBook requirements

Inherits [canlang requirements](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/docs/specification/REQUIREMENTS.md) and [workspace operator context](WORKSPACE_OPERATOR.md), with [portfolio composition](PORTFOLIO.md). Companion draft: [CanBook.can](CanBook.can).

## Purpose and Adoption Goal

Help prospective and existing workspace customers book site tours, sales consultations, and onboarding appointments. Adoption depends on self-service appointments that respect the host's availability.

## Users and Permissions

Require team authentication. Members manage calendars and appointments within their team.

Authorized hosts manage their own or assigned location calendars. Verified customer accounts can book, view, cancel, and request rescheduling of their own appointments; they never gain staff team membership.

## Data and Ownership

Calendar stores team, timezone, default duration, weekly opening hours, and dated availability exceptions. Appointment snapshots its chosen duration and start/end, customer/email, status, and revision. A later default-duration change must not move existing appointments.

Add location, appointment type, host, customer organization/contact, meeting instructions, cancellation cutoff, and attended/no_show outcome. Appointment types define duration and any required meeting-space reference.

## Workflows and Business Rules

Book only inside calendar availability and in a non-empty time range. Timed intervals are half-open so adjacent bookings are allowed. Confirmation must follow the reservation authority's decision; simultaneous requests for the last slot yield one booking. Cancellation releases capacity; rescheduling preserves the original slot until the move succeeds.

Only publish bookable host slots within location hours and host availability. Support staff-created appointments and customer self-service. An appointment needing a scarce room must obtain that room's reservation from the same authority used by CanRent; a host booking alone cannot guarantee it. A failed multi-resource confirmation remains pending and releases provisional holds through recoverable compensation.

When hosts also work published shifts or service visits, reserve the host commitment at the same operator employee-schedule authority; compatible appointments may fit inside the host's assigned duty, but not overlap another appointment/service visit, incompatible shift, absence or travel buffer. The room hold remains a separate recoverable CanRent operation.

## Pages and Interactions

Use the [shared shell and personal configuration](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/docs/specification/REQUIREMENTS.md#standard-shell-and-personal-configuration). Declared sidebar pages are Appointments (`/appointments`) for public availability and verified own appointments, then Host calendars (`/appointments/hosts`) for authorized hosts. Booking and appointment details are contextual views. Use daisyUI; public discovery exposes no other customer's details.

| Page or logical destination | Components and content layout | Canonical actions and conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Location/type availability | `hero` discovery over calendars with an instructions/cutoff `alert`; weekly-hours/closed-day/window tables; per-type book form (from keeps its generated datetime control). | Display only published slots inside location hours and host availability; a displayed slot is not a reservation guarantee. |
| Booking confirmation | Fieldset for permitted customer/contact details, selected host/type/time/duration summary and cancellation-cutoff Alert; confirmation Button. | Book through the existing reservation authority. Any required room and employee-schedule commitment must return their own outcomes before confirmation. |
| Own appointments/history | Upcoming/Past `tabs` partitioning one appointment table; rows show `badge` state, `status` host/room confirmation and an `Appointment coordination` collapse with attempt badges, recovery button and notice badges. Both tabs keep the full cancel/reschedule/discard/retry action set so old failed rows stay resolvable. | Verified customers act only on their own appointments; rescheduling retains the original slot until the move succeeds. |
| Host calendars | Calendar configuration Fieldsets for timezone, durations, hours and dated exceptions; day/week Tabs with an editable appointment-calendar layout and chronological Lists and attendance controls. Typed intake/config controls (`input` hours/opens/closes/reason/name/room, `textarea` instructions, `radio` fold, date-control `calendar` for closed day, `checkbox` active); agenda rows show a state badge with host/room statuses and an attendance form with `checkbox` attend + `textarea` reason. | Authorized hosts maintain assigned calendars, create staff appointments and record attended/no_show under the existing operations. |

A pending multi-resource booking shows recoverable hold/confirmation state, distinct from confirmed attendance. No countdown is authored (no stored remaining duration). Attempt host/room flags without owning captions are not given badge/status presentation; only captioned fields are badged. A conflict retains entered details and explains the now-unavailable slot; rescheduling failure keeps the original appointment visible. Show empty available days and empty customer history without fabricated availability. Surface reminder delivery failure separately from reservation state; bookings inside the reminder window show their confirmation outcome. Preserve unsaved host availability edits after errors and confirm discard on navigation. On mobile stack slot Lists and confirmation fields, keeping timezone and cutoff immediately beside the chosen time. Default-duration changes leave existing appointment summaries intact.

## Personal Configuration

Inherit the shared own-user dialog and base settings. Remember a user's preferred day/week presentation and appointment-history filter. Locale-aware date/time formatting keeps the authoritative calendar timezone visible; presentation preferences never alter availability, cutoffs, host commitments or reminder scheduling. No extra admin/settings area is required.

## Interfaces and Integrations

Use D1 for records, Durable Objects for reservation coordination, and EmailService for customer reminders.

Declare any required workspace reservation capability and customer/lead reference link. CanBook owns appointments; CanRent owns paid workspace reservations.

## Background Actions

Send a reminder one hour before the appointment using its current revision. Bookings made inside that reminder window receive one confirmation instead of a reminder scheduled in the past. Cancellation or movement invalidates older scheduled work.

## Error Handling

Explain invalid durations, invalid time ranges, and booking conflicts without replacing an existing reservation. Show reminder-delivery failures.

## Scope and Completion

Complete when working hours and timezone are respected, a duration change leaves existing bookings intact, competing requests cannot double-book, and cancellation/rescheduling updates reminders.

A prospect can book and cancel a tour, the host can record attendance/no-show, and a room-backed consultation cannot collide with a paid room booking.

Frontend completion additionally requires these journeys:

- A prospect chooses a local-time tour slot, confirms it, finds the cancellation cutoff and cancels their own appointment; the host sees released capacity and the current reminder state.
- A room-backed consultation competing for scarce room/host availability shows a conflict or pending outcome without a false confirmation; a failed customer reschedule leaves the original slot intact.

## Composition and Ownership

Recommended placement: Customer and sales. Own appointments and host-calendar configuration; reference CanCustomer contacts and the shared employee schedule where hosts also serve roster/service duties. CanRent owns required room reservations. See [portfolio composition and ownership](PORTFOLIO.md). Focused example requirements remain valid; composing packages does not require a new source file or an independent deployment per package.


The appointment owner exports Calendar, Window, Type and Appointment plus the canonical book/reschedule/cancel/attendance operations for contextual consumers such as CRM. Exporting provides visibility and enabled model CRUD identities, without assigning host authority or widening record reads. Booking retains `by=authenticated`, active calendar/host, future time, matching customer/contact, verified own contact or authorized host-manager work scope, and a containing published window. CRM stores the resulting readable appointment's exact reference after its authorized page reread; a pending record never proves host/room confirmation. The existing host_calendar/tour/booked fixtures are exported only for inline examples, not production interfaces.

## Authored draft workflow

Calendar WeeklyHours and ClosedDay combine with positive and negative dated Window records and the canonical location `is_open` predicate. Display-only `hours` text never authorizes a booking. Local conversion uses the authored timezone and fold choice; host hours, location hours, holidays and published availability must all permit the requested interval. The location owner separately supports overnight opening intervals and dated overrides. CanBook currently publishes same-local-day host appointments.

Every initial booking or movement has an Attempt with a fresh stable source and immutable interval. Reschedule calls the owning employee `stage` and room `stage` operations with the exact active predecessor source/revisions. Both retain the original allocation while the replacement is pending. The employee authority preserves its existing compatible-duty exception; staging exempts only the predecessor from additional appointment conflicts. CanRent uses a noncommercial VenueReservation in the same capacity ledger as paid bookings. Its provisional outcome is `pending`; only its committed confirm result is `confirmed`. Appointment confirmation waits for both authorities, then adopts the candidate and retires the predecessor for release. A failed candidate leaves the original appointment and reminder intact. The room account and resource remain frozen when another authorized host manager reschedules.

Cancellation and failed movement enter recoverable cleanup. Releases use the recorded host source/revision and explicit frozen venue resource, including cancellation before delayed allocation arrives. Provider tombstones prevent late allocation; late callbacks cannot revive a cancelled attempt. An uncertain pending movement can be discarded while preserving the original confirmed appointment, then its candidate is cleaned up. Failed or uncertain cleanup stays visible and can be retried through the owning operation. Each confirmation/reminder Notice record retains its immutable kind/source with one typed Mail.send association. Its displayed state reads the canonical pending/succeeded/failed/unknown/skipped receipt status; succeeded means provider acceptance and keeps the existing Delivered caption, not recipient reading. Both host-manager and verified-customer readers receive only the receipt identity/status, never its payload or error contents. Receipt progress performs no appointment write. The former pure receipt-copy callback is removed; no business transition callback is lost. Movement/cancellation invalidates the old reminder, and a booking inside the reminder window receives its confirmation without scheduling a past reminder.

A verified unavailable/failed/released host outcome also checks the active Attempt's exact source and commitment revision. If it still owns the confirmed appointment, the appointment becomes unavailable, both host-confirmed flags clear, a reason is shown to the participant and host manager, and its reminder is cancelled. The active host/venue allocations remain recorded for an explicit recovery decision. Unrelated sources/revisions, retired attempts and terminal appointments are unchanged. The schedule revision identifies the commitment rather than ordering its observations, so a delayed confirmed observation cannot restore an unavailable active appointment.

The existing cancel and reschedule actions remain available for an unavailable appointment. A verified participant can resolve provider unavailability after the ordinary cancellation cutoff; the cutoff still applies to changes of a confirmed appointment. Cancellation enters the same resource cleanup, while a reschedule stages a new source and requires fresh host and venue confirmation before adoption. An unsuccessful or discarded candidate preserves the original unavailable state. A successful replacement clears the unavailable reason and retires the predecessor for release. An actually removed host must become eligible again before that host's replacement can succeed; cancellation followed by a new eligible calendar booking remains available. Attendance requires confirmed state, and already admitted reminder work still checks state/version before dispatch.

Focused inline examples cover active-host invalidation, exact source/revision rejection, retained venue and allocation references, retired/terminal no-ops, late confirmation suppression, cancellation/rescheduling after the cutoff, replacement readiness, attendance denial and obsolete reminders. The current parser rejects the canonical `delivery(Mail.send)` field type and the structured enum label on the model derive; a disclosed temporary projection replacing only that type with `text` and that label with its scalar caption parses the remaining source and tables, checking surrounding syntax only, not receipt typing or label rendering. All five status values retain explicit English/Dutch labels in the actual source. These examples and the event/operation trace remain draft evidence; no provider callback, scheduler, compensation or inline-example runner has executed. There is no CanBook JavaScript target to update.

Inline examples cover holiday exclusion, authenticated booking, failed staged movement preserving the original, adoption only after both outcomes, unready resources, stale predecessor identity, repeated ready work, late host results, candidate-only cleanup, unchanged-time rejection and cancellation, with the admitted reminder row additionally observing its fresh pending receipt state. These are authored expectations, not executed scenario evidence. Focused source parsing of the disclosed projection checks surrounding syntax only. No generated CanBook JavaScript, runtime, reservation adapter or email implementation is supplied.

The difficult staged-replacement decision and its three rewritten JEV consultations are saved in [crm-connections-reschedule-20261004](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/design/jev/crm-connections-reschedule-20261004/README.md). Their probability distributions are advice; independent source inspection established why the original same-source replacement could lose the predecessor before the other authority settled. Cross-provider atomicity is not claimed.


## Record-addressed background progress

`Attempt.created` and `Attempt.updated` carry committed identities. Their handlers load the one current Attempt by `event.id` and emit `AttemptProgress`; they do not use `event.after` or infer a historical state. The ready and cleanup handlers each receive one addressed attempt in a separate bounded transaction. Resource outcomes, cancellation, discard, cleanup retries and release results already change that record, so those commits restart its follow-up. An old event therefore observes the current cancelled, active or released state and cannot adopt a stale candidate or release an active original. An adoption retires only its exact recorded predecessor, after both replacement authorities confirmed and neither outcome remains unknown. That predecessor's own committed update admits its release work. This remains compensation across authorities, not an atomic provider transaction.

Before this migration, a pending/cleanup record may have no new event. The authorized `recover_attempt(attempt)` action admits precisely that record and emits the same progress event. It is exposed on the existing Attempt list, checks the existing verified-contact or host-manager location grant, and uses ordinary expected-version admission and receipts. Recovery neither reserves again nor resets release references. A failed/uncertain release still requires `retry_cleanup` to clear its recorded release reference. Repeating recovery or receiving another progress occurrence is safe through current state and recorded deliveries; stable-occurrence replay follows the shared receipt contract. Operators can select old backlog records from the existing list; no new global scheduler or bulk mutation is implied.

The remaining `limit=100` loops in cancellation, discard and cleanup retry are atomic child work under one Appointment. More than 100 matching attempts rejects that operation with no partial writes; this is a local transaction boundary. The old ready/cleanup population scans are gone. The predecessor lookup and committed-event identity lookup each have `limit=1`, justified by the recorded identity/source, rather than limiting a global result set.

Manual source trace, conditional on the unimplemented durable committed-event/outbox runtime:

| Independent attempts needing follow-up | Addressed progress admissions | Behavior at the former scan boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 99 | 99 independent AttemptProgress records, each consumed by ready and cleanup | Each checks one current attempt; other attempts add no loop work |
| 100 | 100 independent AttemptProgress records, each consumed by ready and cleanup | Same per-record path; no batch boundary |
| 101 | 101 independent AttemptProgress records, each consumed by ready and cleanup | The 101st has its own occurrence; it cannot roll back the first 100 |
| 1000 | 1000 independent AttemptProgress records, each consumed by ready and cleanup | The same path repeats without an app-authored tenant/population loop |

This table counts initial record-addressed work, not all subsequent provider results and committed changes. Each adoption/cleanup result may produce further bounded work for that attempt or its exact predecessor. Runtime admission may defer excess total load and a single oversized local atomic operation may fail; no progress claim depends on raising the work budget or truncating a scan. Old records enter this same trace after one authorized recovery admission per record. These are manual expectations, not executed throughput, fairness or journey results. No CanBook MJS implementation is added.
