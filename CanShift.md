# CanShift requirements

Inherits [canlang requirements](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md) and [workspace operator context](WORKSPACE_OPERATOR.md), with [portfolio composition](PORTFOLIO.md). Companion draft: [CanShift.can](CanShift.can).

## Purpose and Adoption Goal

Help workspace managers roster reception, community, sales, and facilities staff across locations and arrange replacements. Adoption depends on published shifts with enough recorded coverage and conflict-free swaps.

## Users and Permissions

Schedulers create/edit shifts. Employees manage their own availability, view their assigned work, and request replacement for their own shift. Only the proposed substitute can accept or reject; a removed member cannot be assigned.

## Data and Ownership

One configurable-name Roster exists per team/operator; its count invariant rejects a second independent schedule, so selecting another root cannot bypass employee commitments. Shift records timezone-aware interval, employee, location, and revision. Availability belongs to an employee. A swap snapshots the shift revision and original employee so later scheduling changes invalidate obsolete requests.

Add location, shift role, required skill, draft/published state, and publication revision. Managers configure role coverage targets per location/time window and staff eligibility. Availability includes entered working hours, dated exceptions, and confirmed absence references where connected.

## Workflows and Business Rules

Assign inside declared availability and reject overlapping active shifts. A swap must name another available team member. Acceptance re-checks the current shift and substitute's availability, replaces the assignment, and invalidates competing requests together. Declining a swap leaves the assignment unchanged.

Draft assignments still reserve staff time against competing drafts and published work. Publication makes the roster visible to employees and emits notices; later changes keep prior publication history. Detect uncovered role windows and require an attributed manager override to publish insufficient coverage. Coverage checks the full configured window that intersects the duty, at its initial instant and every duty boundary. Only published eligible duties and the current candidate count; unrelated drafts do not count, and adjacent eligible duties can jointly cover a window. A substitute must satisfy the role/skill as well as time availability. Cross-location consecutive work requires a manager-entered travel buffer on either adjacent commitment; the nearest earlier/later active work determines that check. Availability and unavailable exceptions cover the complete buffered interval; no automatic route optimizer is implied.

Shared host appointments from CanBook count as employee commitments alongside CanField visits. A shift swap/change cannot strand an incompatible dependent appointment. Current employee identity, active status and skill eligibility come from the canonical shared employee package used by CanOnboard, with unavailable/stale sources surfaced rather than presumed eligible.

## Pages and Interactions

Use the staged [shared shell and personal configuration](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md#standard-shell-and-personal-configuration). Sidebar order is Staff roster /roster for schedulers, then My shifts /roster/mine for active employees. Draft planning and employee published work remain distinct; no new scheduling administration console is needed.

| Page or logical destination | DaisyUI presentation and content | Owning actions and conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staff roster /roster | Location/role Fieldsets with employee/location Selects and role/skill Inputs around generated instant/buffer controls; chronological Commitment agenda with skill Badge, conflict Status, and per-duty publication Status; publish opens a Modal with an override-reason Input. | assign, publish and cancel use the single operator schedule authority; publication gaps require attributed override rather than a hidden bypass. |
| Coverage and dependent commitments | Coverage Table/Fieldset with per-row coverage-met Status. | Coverage CRUD, per-commitment recover_commitment and permitted roster changes recheck skills, absence/availability and dependent work; incompatible appointments/visits need owning host/dispatcher resolution. Uncovered windows surface per row via the coverage-met Status; no aggregate alert is computed in presentation. |
| My availability /roster/mine | Own Availability List and intake Form, including dated exceptions and confirmed absence references when connected. Availability intake places employee Select and available Toggle; rows show an availability Status. | Own Availability CRUD only; employee can read availability without learning hidden draft assignments. |
| My published duties and swaps | Published Duty List with current interval/location/revision; nested Swap List identifies proposed substitute and decision state. Duty rows show a published Status; swap intake places a substitute Select; Swap rows show a decision Status. | request_swap from the current assignee; accept/decline only by the proposed active, eligible substitute. Acceptance invalidates competing requests atomically. |

Mobile duty Cards keep interval, location, skill and conflict details; chronological lists supply an accessible alternative to calendar grouping. Loading/empty and stale employee/absence sources have distinct states. Unavailable eligibility cannot be presumed available. Show pending publication/change/swap notice delivery separately from the committed roster. Preserve entered assignment and override reason on validation or conflict; refresh current revisions before replacing a shift. Declining keeps the original assignment, and a stale or competing acceptance never appears successful.

## Personal Configuration

Inherit [shared shell and personal configuration](https://github.com/veighnsche/canlang/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md#standard-shell-and-personal-configuration). Optional scoped preferences remember permitted location/week/role filters or a chronological versus grouped roster view; ordinary validated save/reset persists them without granting scheduling authority. Employee availability and travel buffers are canonical business records, not personal display settings. Preferences cannot change publication state, business timezone, skills, absence decisions or dependent service commitments.

## Interfaces and Integrations

Use the default team D1 authority and its shared revision fence for assignments, availability, swaps, and connected employee service commitments. One operator-wide ledger coordinates both employees' reservations with current local Employee/Location reads. The source declares no Durable Object placement; external schedule capabilities retain their explicit asynchronous reservation protocol rather than implying a transaction spanning providers.

Declare absence reads from CanLeave if configured. The schedule authority is operator-scoped across locations so a staff member cannot be independently booked by two sites. When CanField is connected, use the same employee schedule: compatible service visits may occur within their duty shift, but swapping/reassigning/cancelling that shift must reject incompatible dependent visits until a dispatcher resolves them.

A connected reschedule uses `ScheduleV1.stage(value,previous_source,previous_revision)` with a fresh candidate source and revision 1. The owner checks the exact active predecessor, employee/location/kind, current availability/skills and ordinary compatible-duty rules; only that predecessor receives an additional conflict exemption. Both commitments remain allocated until the caller has confirmed all other authorities and releases the old source. Failure/cancellation releases only the candidate. One live candidate per predecessor is permitted. Exact candidate retries validate the whole payload; another request cannot replace its identity.

`release(source,revision)` records a retained release fence even if the candidate has not arrived. A delayed stage/reserve cannot reactivate a cancelled source at that revision. The verified adapter maps declared requests/outcomes to the existing trusted ingress; this source does not implement that bridge or promise atomicity with venue booking.

## Background Actions

Assignment changes commit in the schedule authority when a swap is accepted. Queue publication, material change/cancellation, and swap-request/outcome notices against the current revision; do not email obsolete draft assignments.

## Error Handling

Explain invalid ranges and overlapping shifts. Reject unauthorized swap decisions and conflicting reassignments while preserving the existing shift.

## Scope and Completion

Complete when employees cannot alter another employee's availability, an unavailable substitute cannot accept, and two competing swaps produce one replacement.

A manager can publish a reception rota, see an uncovered window, and arrange an eligible substitute without assigning the same person at another location at the same time.

Frontend acceptance journeys:

- A scheduler sees a reception coverage gap, records a justified publication override and publishes the current revision; employees see published duties but not hidden drafts. A stale employee source prevents an unverified assignment.
- Two substitutes attempt competing swaps: only the designated eligible person can decide each request and one replacement commits. An incompatible connected visit remains explicit for dispatcher resolution while rejected edits preserve the original duty.

## Composition and Ownership

Recommended placement: Staff scheduling. Own published rota and swap workflows at the single operator employee-schedule authority, shared with CanField and host commitments in CanBook. Employee identity comes from CanOnboard; private leave decisions remain in CanLeave. See [portfolio composition and ownership](PORTFOLIO.md). Focused example requirements remain valid; composing packages does not require a new source file or an independent deployment per package.

## Draft completion and implementation limits

Publication records an attributed revision and guarded notice intent. Swap requests, acceptance/decline, published reconciliation and cancellation use the same durable notice workflow, with current membership/revision/state checked at dispatch and pending/succeeded/failed/unknown/skipped delivery results retained. Both scheduler and employee views show publication revisions, travel buffers, conflicts, history and their permitted notice outcomes. Scheduler duty actions, history and notices retain their nested Duty binding, matching the desired target rather than the surrounding roster. Each Notice retains a protected `delivery(Mail.send)` association and derives its transport state from that receipt; status-only grants expose identity/status without email payload, result or diagnostic details. There is no copied completion-state handler. The derived state preserves the existing English/Dutch case captions explicitly; `succeeded`/Sent is provider acceptance, not delivery/read proof.

Current employee role, skills and location grants are rechecked at assignment/publication/substitution/reconciliation. EmployeeChanged, membership removal, location deactivation and availability create/update handlers now only emit an EligibilityReview carrying identities; a valid availability edit commits without attempting owner-wide reconciliation in its own transaction. Two review handlers then enumerate the finite admitted cohort — every Commitment identity for review_commitment, every Swap identity for review_swap — and recheck each record against current state when its child executes: current eligibility and role for commitments; current publication, conflict, eligibility, version, role, skill, availability and travel state for swaps. Cohort size is not a capacity rule: 499, 500, 501 and 1,000 admitted identities all belong to the same complete contract, and the old rejecting 500-row transaction bounds are gone. Each scanned available identity receives one terminal outcome using state at its child checkpoint; a failed child does not stop other children, and a fully scanned run with failed children reports attention, never successful completion. The swap child reads actual commitment eligibility itself, so commitment and swap children are correct in either order; previously committed conflict or obsolete decisions remain sticky and are not automatically cleared. Review retains dependent visits, host appointments and interviews for their owning app to resolve. Scheduler reconciliation or cancellation refuses to strand those dependencies. Historical commitments stay outside effective flagging scans. Current eligibility/coverage and admission deny ineligible work immediately. The existing atomic 100-swap loops in accept/cancel/reconcile, the 100-conflict absence processing in reservation ingress and the local 100-swap bound in recover_commitment keep their all-or-reject semantics; they are honest bounds, not silently partial progress. The existing scheduler commitment view exposes canonical `recover_commitment` for one selected active current/future commitment: it rechecks current eligibility/role, retains and flags the commitment, emits its unavailable outcome, and invalidates only that commitment’s invalid pending swaps. It does not clear an existing conflict, move/release reservations or silently restore work. Existing reconcile/cancel and connected owning-app resolution remain necessary. The local 100-swap bound rejects excess atomically; this action is concrete per-record recovery, not a new global partition/cursor or per-record periodic polling guarantee.

ScheduleV1, CommitmentRequest and the existing retained-predecessor stage/release protocol keep their signatures. Reserve replay validates the entire payload and cannot rewrite an admitted source at a higher revision; all current Book/Hire/Field/Leave producers retain initial reservation identities or stage fresh replacements. Exact reserve/stage retries report unavailable for conflicting or currently ineligible commitments without releasing them. Release-before-arrival fences remain retained; a duty release also refuses unresolved dependent appointments/visits/interviews; negative buffers and buffered unavailable exceptions are rejected, and absence acceptance marks conflicting work without deleting it. Reserve/stage ingress still depends on the proposed verified adapter and existing source fences. No new authority, manifest or external scheduling API is implemented.

Reconciliation checks both the former and proposed interval against intersecting configured coverage windows, so moving a published duty away cannot hide its original gap. Successful available substitution clears the resolved conflict flag; inactive or unpublished duties reject acceptance. New assignments, publication, swaps and reservation ingress deny inactive locations immediately, while cancellation and owning-app recovery retain frozen commitments.

Inline examples cover one roster per team, publication eligibility, adjacent-window coverage versus a gap, entered cross-location travel buffers, buffered overlaps/unavailable exceptions, conflict-clearing substitution, inactive/unpublished substitution rejection, old-window reconciliation gaps, immutable reserve replay, declined swaps, authorized per-commitment eligibility recovery versus denied member calls, and pending/succeeded/failed/unknown/skipped associated notice observations. The former employee_changed/member_removed synchronous-outcome examples were removed with the adapter conversion: those scenarios now only emit EligibilityReview, and per-child review cases await specified handler-fixture binding, so no invented each example selectors are authored. Their matching JavaScript uses deferred fixture callbacks under the same target contract. Node syntax checks do not execute these workflows or establish distributed correctness. The old syntax prototype parsed the scheduling corrections before receipt association migration, but it rejects current `delivery(Mail.send)` syntax (as it does CanCheck); it cannot verify the final source under the settled contract. Compilation, stdlib/UI functions, schedule authority coordination, delivery adapters and the BDD runner remain implementation work; all CanShift.mjs imports are proposed contracts.
